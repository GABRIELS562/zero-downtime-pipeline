## 🔬 Forensic Investigation → DevOps Engineering

### **1. Evidence Collection**

**Forensic Investigation:**
- Photograph crime scene from multiple angles
- Collect physical evidence with chain of custody
- Document everything with timestamps
- Preserve evidence integrity

**DevOps Application:**
```bash
# Comprehensive deployment evidence collection
EVIDENCE_DIR="/tmp/deployment-evidence-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
LOG_FILE="$EVIDENCE_DIR/deployment-workflow.log"

# Immutable evidence preservation
cat > "$LOG_FILE" << EOF
=== DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW FORENSIC EVIDENCE ===
Script Start: $(date -Iseconds)
User: $(whoami)
Git Commit: $(git rev-parse HEAD)
Build Artifacts: $(docker images --format "table {{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}\t{{.ID}}\t{{.CreatedSince}}")
=== FORENSIC AUDIT TRAIL BEGINS ===
EOF
```

**Why This Matters in DevOps:**
- Every deployment creates immutable audit trail
- Compliance requirements (FDA, SOX) demand evidence
- Root cause analysis needs historical data
- Rollback decisions require deployment provenance

---

### **2. Chain of Custody**

**Forensic Investigation:**
- Document who handled evidence when
- Maintain unbroken chain from collection to court
- Digital signatures for integrity
- Tamper-evident storage

**DevOps Application:**
```yaml
# Docker labels for deployment provenance
labels:
  - "forensic.build_id=${BUILD_ID}"
  - "forensic.git_commit=${GIT_COMMIT}" 
  - "forensic.build_timestamp=${BUILD_TIMESTAMP}"
  - "forensic.compliance=FDA_21_CFR_11"
  - "forensic.approver=${APPROVER_ID}"
```

```groovy
// Jenkins pipeline approval gates
input(
    id: 'DeploymentApproval',
    message: '🚨 Production Pharma Deployment Approval Required',
    parameters: [
        string(name: 'APPROVER_ID', description: 'Approver employee ID'),
        choice(name: 'RISK_ACCEPTANCE', choices: ['ACCEPT_RISK', 'REJECT_DEPLOYMENT'])
    ],
    submitter: 'pharma-deployment-approvers'
)
```

**Why This Matters in DevOps:**
- Regulatory compliance requires approval trails
- Security incidents need deployment history
- Change management demands accountability
- Audit trails prevent unauthorized changes

---

### **3. Risk Assessment**

**Forensic Investigation:**
- Assess crime scene safety before entry
- Evaluate evidence contamination risk  
- Prioritize high-value evidence collection
- Determine investigation approach

**DevOps Application:**
```bash
# Multi-factor risk calculation
perform_risk_assessment() {
    local risk_score=0
    
    # Environment risk (Production = +30 points)
    [[ "${ENVIRONMENT}" == "production" ]] && risk_score=$((risk_score + 30))
    
    # Application risk (Finance = +25, Pharma = +30)
    [[ "${APPLICATION}" == *"finance"* ]] && risk_score=$((risk_score + 25))
    [[ "${APPLICATION}" == *"pharma"* ]] && risk_score=$((risk_score + 30))
    
    # Timing risk (Business hours = +15)
    current_hour=$(date +%H)
    [[ $current_hour -ge 9 && $current_hour -lt 17 ]] && risk_score=$((risk_score + 15))
    
    # Risk classification: Critical (70+), High (40+), Medium (20+), Low (0+)
    if [[ $risk_score -ge 70 ]]; then
        echo "RISK LEVEL: CRITICAL - Enhanced monitoring and approval required"
        REQUIRES_APPROVAL=true
    fi
}
```

**Why This Matters in DevOps:**
- Production deployments affect revenue
- Market hours deployments risk business disruption
- Compliance violations have legal consequences
- Systematic risk assessment prevents incidents

---

### **4. Impact Analysis**

**Forensic Investigation:**
- Determine scope of criminal activity
- Assess financial impact
- Identify affected parties
- Prioritize investigation resources

**DevOps Application:**
```bash
# Business impact monitoring during deployment
monitor_application_health() {
    # Finance: Latency <50ms, Success Rate >99.99%
    if [[ "$APPLICATION" == *"finance"* ]]; then
        current_latency=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}" http://localhost:8080/health/ultra-low-latency)
        current_latency_ms=$(echo "$current_latency * 1000" | bc)
        
        if (( $(echo "$current_latency_ms > 50" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "❌ BUSINESS IMPACT: Latency ${current_latency_ms}ms exceeds 50ms SLA"
            perform_rollback "$APPLICATION" "Latency SLA violation"
        fi
    fi
    
    # Pharma: Efficiency >98%, Batch Integrity >98%
    if [[ "$APPLICATION" == *"pharma"* ]]; then
        efficiency=$(curl -s http://localhost:8090/api/v1/efficiency | jq -r '.efficiency_percent')
        
        if (( $(echo "$efficiency < 98.0" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "❌ BUSINESS IMPACT: Manufacturing efficiency ${efficiency}% below 98% requirement"
            perform_rollback "$APPLICATION" "Manufacturing efficiency violation"
        fi
    fi
}
```

**Why This Matters in DevOps:**
- Trading systems: Every millisecond costs money
- Manufacturing: Efficiency drops affect production quotas
- Real-time monitoring prevents revenue loss
- Automated rollback protects business metrics

---

### **5. Root Cause Analysis**

**Forensic Investigation:**
- Systematic examination of evidence
- Timeline reconstruction
- Hypothesis testing
- Definitive conclusions

**DevOps Application:**
```bash
perform_failure_forensics() {
    echo "=== FAILURE FORENSICS ANALYSIS ===" > ${EVIDENCE_PATH}/failure-forensics.txt
    echo "Failure Timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)" >> ${EVIDENCE_PATH}/failure-forensics.txt
    
    # Evidence collection
    echo "Build Artifacts: ${BUILD_URL}artifact/" >> ${EVIDENCE_PATH}/failure-forensics.txt
    echo "Security Scan Results: $(ls -la ${EVIDENCE_PATH}/trivy-*.json)" >> ${EVIDENCE_PATH}/failure-forensics.txt
    echo "Performance Metrics: $(curl -s http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=up)" >> ${EVIDENCE_PATH}/failure-forensics.txt
    
    # Root cause analysis preparation
    echo "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REQUIRED:" >> ${EVIDENCE_PATH}/failure-forensics.txt
    echo "- Review build logs for error patterns" >> ${EVIDENCE_PATH}/failure-forensics.txt
    echo "- Analyze security scan results for vulnerabilities" >> ${EVIDENCE_PATH}/failure-forensics.txt
    echo "- Check infrastructure status and resource utilization" >> ${EVIDENCE_PATH}/failure-forensics.txt
    echo "- Validate compliance requirements and approval gates" >> ${EVIDENCE_PATH}/failure-forensics.txt
}
```

**Why This Matters in DevOps:**
- Failed deployments need systematic investigation
- Pattern recognition prevents recurring issues
- Evidence-based decisions improve reliability
- Post-incident reviews drive continuous improvement

def validate_fda_compliance():
    compliance_checks = {
        "electronic_records": verify_digital_signatures(),
        "audit_trail": validate_immutable_logging(),
        "access_control": check_role_based_permissions(),
        "data_integrity": verify_encryption_and_backup()
    }
    
    # Generate compliance certificate
    if all(compliance_checks.values()):
        generate_compliance_certificate("FDA_21_CFR_11")
        return True
    return False
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Pharmaceutical companies struggle with DevOps compliance
- Your lab background understands regulatory requirements
