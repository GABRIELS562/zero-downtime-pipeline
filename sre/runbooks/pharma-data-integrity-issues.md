# 🚨 Pharma Manufacturing: FDA Data Integrity Issues

## 📋 SRE Runbook: Data Integrity SLI <99.99%

**Service**: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing System  
**SLO**: 99.99% data integrity rate (FDA 21 CFR Part 11)  
**Severity**: CRITICAL (regulatory compliance risk)

---

## 🚦 Immediate Response (0-2 minutes)

### 1. Verify the Alert
```bash
# Check current data integrity rate
curl http://pharma-manufacturing-service/health/sre

# Check FDA audit readiness status
curl http://pharma-manufacturing-service/health/gmp-compliance
```

### 2. Assess Regulatory Impact
- **Any Data Integrity Issue**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Patient safety and FDA compliance at risk
- **Error Budget**: Very conservative - any violation consumes significant budget
- **Immediate Action**: STOP all data modifications until resolved

### 3. Secure Evidence
```bash
# Capture current state for FDA audit trail
kubectl logs -n pharma-manufacturing deployment/manufacturing-app --since=10m > /tmp/incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log

# Take database snapshot for forensic analysis
pg_dump pharma_manufacturing_db > /tmp/db-snapshot-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql
```

## 🔍 Diagnosis (2-10 minutes)

### Step 1: Identify Data Integrity Failures
```sql
-- Check recent data validation failures
SELECT 
    validation_timestamp,
    validation_type,
    error_message,
    affected_batch_id,
    user_id
FROM data_validation_log 
WHERE validation_status = 'FAILED' 
AND validation_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY validation_timestamp DESC;
```

### Step 2: Check Electronic Signature Integrity
```sql
-- Verify electronic signature chain integrity
SELECT 
    signature_id,
    document_id,
    signer_id,
    signature_timestamp,
    hash_verification_status
FROM electronic_signatures 
WHERE hash_verification_status != 'VALID'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

### Step 3: Audit Trail Completeness
```sql
-- Check for missing audit trail entries
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_operations,
    COUNT(audit_trail_id) as audited_operations,
    (COUNT(*) - COUNT(audit_trail_id)) as missing_audit_entries
FROM manufacturing_operations mo
LEFT JOIN audit_trail at ON mo.operation_id = at.operation_id
WHERE mo.operation_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

## 🛠 Mitigation Steps

### CRITICAL: Immediate Data Protection
```bash
# 1. Enable read-only mode to prevent further data corruption
kubectl patch deployment manufacturing-app -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"app","env":[{"name":"READ_ONLY_MODE","value":"true"}]}]}}}}'

# 2. Stop all batch operations
kubectl scale deployment batch-processor --replicas=0 -n pharma-manufacturing

# 3. Notify all users of system maintenance
# Send maintenance notification via manufacturing alert system
```

### Data Recovery Options

#### Option 1: Recent Backup Restoration (if <1 hour data loss acceptable)
```bash
# Restore from last known good backup
./scripts/restore-database.sh --timestamp="2024-01-15T14:00:00Z"

# Verify data integrity after restore
python scripts/verify-data-integrity.py --full-check
```

#### Option 2: Selective Data Correction (if specific records affected)
```sql
-- Example: Fix corrupted batch record
UPDATE batch_records 
SET data_integrity_hash = calculate_hash(batch_data)
WHERE batch_id = 'AFFECTED_BATCH_ID';

-- Update audit trail
INSERT INTO audit_trail (operation_id, action, user_id, timestamp, description)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'DATA_CORRECTION', 'SYSTEM_ADMIN', NOW(), 'Emergency data integrity correction');
```

#### Option 3: Full System Validation (if widespread corruption)
```bash
# Run comprehensive data integrity check
python scripts/comprehensive-data-integrity-check.py

# Generate FDA-compliant incident report
python scripts/generate-incident-report.py --type="DATA_INTEGRITY" --timestamp="$(date -Iseconds)"
```

## 📢 Communication (FDA Compliance Critical)

### Immediate Notifications (within 5 minutes)
- **Quality Assurance Manager**: Call immediately
- **Regulatory Affairs**: Email with incident details
- **IT Security**: Notify of potential data breach
- **Manufacturing Operations**: Stop all production

### Regulatory Notifications
```bash
# Generate preliminary FDA incident report
cat > /tmp/fda-incident-report.txt << EOF
PRELIMINARY FDA INCIDENT REPORT
================================
Incident ID: PHARMA-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
Date/Time: $(date -Iseconds)
System: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Data System
Issue: Data Integrity SLI below 99.99% threshold
Batch Impact: [TO BE DETERMINED]
Patient Safety Impact: [UNDER INVESTIGATION]
Immediate Actions: Production stopped, read-only mode enabled
Estimated Resolution: [TO BE DETERMINED]
Contact: [QUALITY MANAGER CONTACT]
EOF
```

### Stakeholder Updates (every 30 minutes until resolved)
- **Executive Team**: If production impact >2 hours
- **FDA Contact**: If patient safety risk identified
- **Manufacturing Partners**: If supply chain affected

## 📈 Monitoring & Validation

### Verify Resolution
```bash
# Check data integrity rate returns to 99.99%+
curl http://pharma-manufacturing-service/health/sre | jq '.data_integrity_rate'

# Verify FDA audit readiness
curl http://pharma-manufacturing-service/health/sre | jq '.fda_audit_ready'

# Run full GMP compliance check
python scripts/gmp-compliance-check.py --full-validation
```

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Data integrity rate >99.99% for 30 minutes
- ✅ All electronic signatures verified
- ✅ Complete audit trail for all operations
- ✅ FDA incident report completed
- ✅ GMP compliance status: "compliant"

## 🎯 SRE Learning Notes

**Regulatory Context**: Data integrity violations in pharmaceutical manufacturing can result in:
- FDA Warning Letters
- Product recalls
- Manufacturing facility shutdown
- Criminal charges in severe cases

**Error Budget Impact**: Data integrity issues consume 10x normal error budget due to severity. Single incident may trigger deployment freeze for weeks.

**Business Impact**: 
- Production shutdown costs ~$100K/hour
- FDA investigation costs ~$500K minimum
- Product recall costs ~$10M+ average
- Reputation damage: Immeasurable

**Prevention Focus**: SRE emphasis on prevention rather than response due to regulatory constraints.
