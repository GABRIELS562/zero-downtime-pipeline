# Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Implementation

## 🎯 SRE Overview for DevOps Portfolio

This directory contains **Site Reliability Engineering** components added to demonstrate SRE knowledge alongside DevOps skills.

### 🔍 What is SRE?
Site Reliability Engineering is Google's approach to DevOps that applies software engineering principles to infrastructure and operations problems.

### 📊 SRE Components in This Project

#### 1. Service Level Indicators (SLIs)
**What we measure:**
- **Availability**: Percentage of successful requests
- **Latency**: Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Throughput**: Requests per second

#### 2. Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
**What we promise:**
- **Finance Trading**: 99.9% availability, <50ms p95 latency
- **Pharma Manufacturing**: 99.95% availability, <100ms p95 latency

#### 3. Error Budgets
**How much failure we can tolerate:**
- Based on SLO targets (e.g., 99.9% = 0.1% error budget)
- Tracked monthly and consumed by incidents
- Used to balance feature velocity vs. reliability
