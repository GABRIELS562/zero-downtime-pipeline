- Deployment success rate across all systems
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) 
- Total deployments per week
- Business impact scores by application
- Deployment frequency trends
- Rollback rates by application
- Executive-level KPIs (deploy time, failed deployments, lead time, hotfixes)
- Deployment risk assessment heatmap

**Business Value:** Provides high-level view of deployment health and business impact for executive decision-making.

### 2. Finance Trading Business Impact (`finance-trading-business-impact.json`)
**Target Audience:** Trading desk managers, Risk managers, Finance leadership

**Key Metrics:**
- Revenue impact during deployments (real-time tracking)
- Trading volume monitoring
- Profit & Loss (P&L) impact
- Pre/during/post deployment comparison

**Business Value:** Ensures manufacturing efficiency is maintained during deployments while staying FDA compliant.

### 4. Deployment Performance & MTTR (`deployment-performance-mttr.json`)
**Target Audience:** DevOps teams, SRE teams, Engineering managers

**Key Metrics:**
- Deployment success rates by team/application
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) analytics
- Deployment frequency and velocity
- Change failure rates
- Lead time distribution
- Root cause analysis of failed deployments
- Performance benchmarking across teams
- Rollback rate analysis

**Business Value:** Provides detailed operational metrics to improve deployment processes and reduce downtime.

## Installation

1. Import the JSON files into your Grafana instance
2. Configure Prometheus data sources
3. Ensure the following metrics are available in your environment:
   - `deployment_*` (deployment status, duration, success rates)
   - `trading_*` (revenue, volume, P&L metrics)
   - `manufacturing_*` (efficiency, throughput, line status)
   - `sensor_*` (environmental monitoring)
   - `batch_*` (batch processing and integrity)
   - `audit_*` (compliance and audit metrics)
