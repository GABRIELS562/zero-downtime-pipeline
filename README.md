## Forensic Risk Assessment Principles Applied to Deployment Safety

### 1. **Evidence Chain of Custody → Deployment Traceability**
- Every deployment change is tracked with immutable audit logs
- Git SHA, timestamp, approver, and rollback points are recorded
- Deployment artifacts are cryptographically signed and verified

### 2. **Risk Assessment → Pre-deployment Validation**
- **Finance Trading**: Sub-millisecond latency requirements, market impact analysis
- **Pharma Manufacturing**: Regulatory compliance checks, batch traceability
- Automated risk scoring based on change scope and business criticality

### 3. **Incident Response → Automated Rollback**
- **Detection**: Sub-50ms health checks with circuit breakers
- **Analysis**: Real-time anomaly detection and root cause analysis
- **Containment**: Immediate traffic shifting and rollback triggers
- **Recovery**: Automated rollback with data consistency checks

### 4. **Forensic Timeline → Deployment Timeline**
- Detailed timeline of deployment phases with health metrics
- Canary deployment progression with decision points
- Rollback decision tree based on quantified risk thresholds

## Key Features

### Sub-50ms Health Checks
- Optimized TCP health checks with connection pooling
- Redis-based health state caching
- Circuit breaker pattern for fast failure detection
- Parallel health check execution

### Business-Critical Deployment Strategy
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime switches
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual traffic shifting (1% → 5% → 25% → 100%)
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime configuration changes
- **Database Migrations**: Backward-compatible schema changes

### Compliance & Auditing
- **SOX Compliance**: Separation of duties, approval workflows
- **FDA 21 CFR Part 11**: Electronic records and signatures
- **PCI DSS**: Secure payment processing deployments
- **GDPR**: Data protection impact assessments

## Getting Started

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd zero-downtime-pipeline
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy Finance Trading App**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-finance.sh --env production --strategy canary
   ```

3. **Deploy Pharma Manufacturing App**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-pharma.sh --env production --strategy blue-green
   ```

This pipeline demonstrates enterprise-grade deployment practices suitable for financial services and pharmaceutical companies where downtime costs millions and regulatory compliance is mandatory.
