# Zero-Downtime Pipeline Screenshots

This folder contains monitoring dashboards for the Finance and Pharma applications demonstrating production GitOps deployments with ArgoCD.

## Screenshot Overview

### Finance Application Monitoring
- **01-finance-activity-logs.png** - Real-time AAPL trading activity logs with FINANCE_MONITOR labels
- **02-finance-stock-metrics.png** - Stock price monitoring dashboard showing consistent data flow
- **03-finance-request-rate.png** - Extended time view of request patterns and system stability

### Pharma Application Monitoring  
- **04-pharma-equipment-logs.png** - Reactor equipment monitoring with PHARMA_MONITOR operations
- **05-pharma-processing-debug.png** - Processing rate dashboard showing backend API integration in progress

## System Status

### Production Ready
- **Finance Trading System**: Full monitoring stack operational
  - Real-time AAPL trading data processing
  - Consistent request rate monitoring  
  - Complete log aggregation via Loki

### Development in Progress
- **Pharma Manufacturing System**: Equipment monitoring operational
  - Reactor operations logging functional
  - Processing rate API integration pending
  - Demonstrates active troubleshooting workflow

## Technical Implementation

- **Log Collection**: Promtail → Loki → Grafana
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- **Deployment**: ArgoCD GitOps automation
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes (K3s) with high availability

## Key Demonstrables

1. **Multi-application monitoring** across different business domains
2. **Real production data** processing and visualization
3. **GitOps deployment patterns** with ArgoCD
4. **Troubleshooting processes** in live environments
5. **Log aggregation** from distributed microservices

This represents a realistic production environment where multiple applications are at different stages of development and monitoring maturity.
